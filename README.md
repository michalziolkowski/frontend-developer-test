### DESIGN
#### Design Research
I have reviewed several dating apps to find inspiration for UI, mainly focusing on users list as this is what the test task is about. Here are some features I liked.

- **Tinder**
  - Swiping mechanism for user like/dislike. At this point it is very natural for dating apps because of Tinder's success and it makes browsing and interacting with user list very dynamic and quick.
  - Browsing user photos by clicking on part of an image

- **Happn**
  - This one has a vertical list, if you want to skip user just swipe down as you do on social apps when not intereseted in content

#### Design Prototype
I have merged some properties of reviewed apps that I like and came up with original design with **FeelD* brand colors.
